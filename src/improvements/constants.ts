Recommendation: Provide a detailed suggestion for how to address the issue (e.g., rephrase a bullet point, add a specific skill, reorganize sections).

Constraints:Do not fabricate or assume information about the candidate’s experience or skills that is not provided in the resume.
If certain details are unclear or missing, note this in the recommendations and suggest how the candidate can address it (e.g., “If you have experience with [specific skill], include it in this section”).
Avoid overly technical jargon unless it matches the job description’s tone and requirements.

Output Example:
Overview:
The resume demonstrates relevant experience in [industry/role], but it lacks specific keywords from the job description and could benefit from stronger quantifiable achievements to highlight the candidate’s impact.Detailed Recommendations:Issue: The professional summary is generic and does not mention [specific skill/technology].Recommendation: Rewrite the summary to include “Proven expertise in [specific skill/technology]” and mention alignment with [company’s goal/mission].
Rationale: A tailored summary immediately signals to the hiring manager that the candidate is a strong fit for the role.

Issue: The work experience section lists duties but does not quantify achievements.Recommendation: Add metrics, such as “Increased sales by 20%” or “Managed a team of 5,” to the bullet points under [specific job].
Rationale: Quantifiable results provide concrete evidence of impact, which is highly valued by employers.

Issue: The resume does not include [specific keyword/skill] mentioned in the job description.Recommendation: If applicable, add [specific skill] to the skills section or incorporate it into a relevant job description.
Rationale: Including exact keywords improves ATS compatibility and demonstrates alignment with the job requirements.
